        <h4>Overview:
          <a class="pdf-button" href="Project_report-1.pdf" target="_blank">Full IRCA Report</a>
        </h4>
        <p>Worked with a team of 4 to create a solution that uses a primary
           robot (robot P) to guide a visiting robot (robot S) to POIs.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Robot P:
            Has access to an RGB-D camera and a Laser Scanner. It is also
            assumed that this robot can map the environment with the software
            it has on it. This robot cannot access the position of robot S
            or any other topic private to robot S. It can communicate with
            robot S only through a `/comm` topic, which is of type
            `std_msgs/String`.
          <li>Robot S:
            We assume that this robot has access only to an RGB camera. This
            robot does not have a Laser Scanner and a software for SLAM or
            Localization. It does not know the map of the Hospital as well.
            Moreover, it cannot access the map information gained by robot P.
            It can communicate with robot P through a topic named `/comm` which
            is of type `std_msgs/String`. It can also access
            its own camera topic. This robot can access its other topics as
            well, like other nodes that may process the camera topic and publish
            processed information on new topics.
          </li>
        </ul>
          <h4>Challenges:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Finding a method to have robot S follow robot M efficiently.</li>
            <li>Tuning gmapping coordinates to optimize map by robot M.</li>
            <li>Interfacing multiple packages together to work seamlessly.</li>
          </ul>

                          text file to be interpreted</figcaption>

          </div>-->
          <h4>Outcome:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Robot M succesfully maps the AWS Hospital World with sufficient
                accuracy to visit POIs and lead visiting robot S to POIs.</li>
            <li>Implement a trained computer vision classifier on robot M as a
                bonus task.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          <h4>Skills Learned:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>ROS tools and packages</li>
            <li>AWS resources</li>
            <li>Integrating available software packages together and with
                original code.</li>
