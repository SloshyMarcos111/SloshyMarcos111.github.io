        <h4>Overview:</h4>
        <p>Looking for things to do during quarantine, I found a NASA design
           challenge hosted by GrabCad. The light-weight excavator vehicle under
           development facilitates the transport of the vehicle through space,
           but also limits the downward force required by traditional excavation
           techniques. The challenge consisted of improving the excavator/regolith
           storage drum for their vehicle to use.
          </p>
          <h4>Purpose:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Practice designing under set parameters and expected outcomes</li>
            <li>Get exposure to the design techniques used at NASA</li>
            <li>Practice CAD and SolidWorks simulation</li>
            <li>Practice product rendering and presentation</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Challenges:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Learn a new software and debug simulation and provide results
                within deadlines</li>
            <li>Create a simulation that would provide accurate results, but
                use assumptions that were valid</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Outcome:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Spring loaded shovels are set by ground reaction force when in
                contact and triggered when the counter force is insufficient
                (no longer in contact with the ground)</li>
            <li>A drum is made of three modulses that consist of two
                oppposite facing shovels that trigger at the same time, allowing
                for some cancelation of forces and decreasing net force on the
                mechanism</li>
            <li>Spring loaded shovels work in the direction of gravitational
                force and the rotation of the drum to maximize momentum when
                coming into contact with the ground</li>
            <li>Aluminum sheet metal assembly with weight saving cut-outs where
                possible to maximize regolith collection capacity to weight
                ratio</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Things to consider if future design iterations persued:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Springs loose elasticity over time - because this excavaotor is
                to be used shortly before human arrival, parts should only family
                after replacement and maintanance is possible</li>
            <li>Further sand proofing required to prevent jamming and friction</li>
          </ul>
