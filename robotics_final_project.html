        <h4>Overview:
                </h4>
        <p>Worked with a team of 4 to design a system to navigate a map filled
           with ArUco Markers. Before physical implementation, the design was
           tested in Gazebo. The physical platform of the project was an mBot Ranger
           and the sensor used was an RGB camera (IP camera application running
           on a smartphone). The platform used the OpenCV and ArUco libraries
           to navigate the map and recognize the markers. The bot searches for
           the first marker (ordered by ArUco Marker ID) and navigate to it and
           repeat until all markers are visited.
           Some applications that this could serve is a robot navigating to a
           POI and fulfilling a task, then going on to the next. Such
           applications are found a lot in warehouse automation.
           The design can also serve as a marker follower and would be ideal
           for primary and secondary robot navigation.</p>

          <h4>Purpose:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Collaborate with a team to produce an original solution to
                a problem.</li>
            <li>Design a system that can allow for navigation to points of
                interest that are within range.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Challenges:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Designing original Gazebo world with ArUco Markers in place</li>
            <li>Port code from simulation platform to physical mBot Ranger
                platform.</li>
            <li>Adjust design for physical implementation (sensor noise,
                mechanical issues, etc.)</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Outcome:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Used Gazebo to simulate and validate a control algorithm to
                implement physically. Created a design that allows for POIs
                (marked with ArUco tags)to be visited sequentially with a mobile
                robot equipped with an RGB camera.</li>
            <li>Navigation Algorithm:
              <ul>
                <li>Search for next ArUco (corresponding ID) by rotating</li>
                <li>Once found (match center of marker with center of input
                    frame)</li>
                <li>Continue towards marker with periodic adjustments to
                    trajectory if centers are misaligned outside of a threshold</li>
                <li>Repeat with next ArUco ID</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Follow Algorithm:
              <ul>
                <li>Search for ArUco to follow (corresponding ID) by rotating</li>
                <li>Once found (match center of marker with center of input
                    frame)</li>
                <li>Continue towards marker with periodic adjustments to
                    trajectory if centers are misaligned outside of a threshold</li>
                <li>Stop if within a certain range of marker to avoid collision</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
