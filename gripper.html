        <h4>Overview:</h4>
        <p>During my first co-op as a systems test engineering co-op at iRobot,
          I had access to industrial 3D printers such as Objet, Fortus,
          MarkForged, and HP platforms and I had to take advantage of the
          resources in the limited time. Being very interested in soft robotics,
          and having produced actuators by silicone molding, I explored the
          feasibility of printing an soft robotic actuator with an Objet printer
          with variable stiffness material printing.
          </p>
          <h4>Purpose:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>To experiment with the feasibility of manufacturing a soft robotic</li>
            <li>component with a Objet 3D printer</li>
            <li>Exercise practical CAD modeling skills</li>
            <li>Go through general procedures when designing with industrial 3D printers</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Challenges:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Printer tolerances required some iteration and testing for better understanding</li>
            <li>Interface between solid and flexible material needed to be substantial in area for secure adhesion</li>
            <li>Air pocket number, depth, and height had to be experimentally optimized</li>
            <li>Elastic modulus of the flexible material had to be experimentally optimized</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Outcome:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Small samples with different elastic moduli were printed to
               verify their strength and flexibility</li>
            <li>Finger modules were printed individually to verify the
               tolerances of the printers and the effectiveness of the fingers</li>
            <li>Contact surface area and configuration was altered to create
               resistant and durable seals between the two materials and parts</li>
            <li>Parts of the gripper were printed in a modular form for
               individual testing, and the number of air pockets, their depth,
               and height were verified and changed accordingly
               (palm, fingers, etc.)</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Skills Learned:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Developed skills to work with industrial 3D printers
                (Objet variable stiffness printer): Printing assemblies,
                tolerances, and durability expectation</li>
            <li>Applied PneuNets (essential design concept in soft robotics)
                in a gripper design</li>
          </ul>
