        <h1>Experience</h1>
        <h2>I have completed three sixth month co-ops in the robotics
           industry focusing on hardware roles. The size, culture, and
           responsibility differed at each of my positions encouraging me to
           adapt and learn based on those environments.

      <h2>Systems Test Engineering Co-op</h2>
      <p>iRobot was a great first co-op because it provided me with a great
         balance of guidance and freedom. I had the freedom to develop solutions
         but was also guided thoroughly through the process. I was introduced to
         machining, rapid prototyping, and testing. The machine shop and rapid
         prototyping lab were free to use and we were encourage to help out.
         I took weekly courses with machinists, electrical technicians,
         and worked closely with industrial rapid prototyping equipment.</p>

      <h2>Hardware Engineering Co-op</h2>
      <p>I had much more independence and responsibility at my second position
         at Amazon Robotics as a hardware engineering co-op. I frequently
         created and pushed ECOs design changes and standards (ISO) switches
         for parts, assemblies, and drawings. In addition to testing, fixture
         design, assembly.</p>

      <h2>Engineering Co-op</h2>
      <p>My third co-op at TechShare in Tokyo, Japan, in addition to technical
         design for robotic arm (uFactory and Dobot platforms) end-effectors
         and demo parts, I went to 4 major robotics exhibitions in Japan and
         exhibited and explained our developed systems in both English and
         Japanese. In addition to this, the company was very small (about 10
         full-time workers) and required me to grow far from my comfort zone
         to an area of marketing and business in a foreign language. </p>
