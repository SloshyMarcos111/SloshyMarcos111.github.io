        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am a 5th year mechanical and computer engineering student at
           Northeastern University in Boston, USA. My interest in bio-inspired
           design led me to pursue mechanical engineering to create technologies
           that borrow from mechanisms found in the world around us. I started
           the computer engineering curriculum to improve my software and
           hardware skills and become a more rounded engineer better equipped
           for the design of robotic systems that can improve societyâ€™s quality
           of life.</p>
        <p>I have been playing the violin since the age of 5 and love to play in
           my free time as well as go to orchestral performances. I also like to
           draw and have included some of my work in this portfolio.</p>
        <p>Being Puerto Rican, I was raised with Spanish. In addition, I have
           taken interest in the Japanese language. This has prompted me to make
           language partners and explore different perspectives from a culture
           very different from my own.</p>
