        <h4>Overview:</h4>
        <p>With drone technology advancing quickly, drone applications continue
           to grow. Being one of the major limiting factors, flight time should
           be extended so drones can continue their mission without traditional
           charging interruptions, where drones would abandon the mission and
           have to land to charge. My capstone project group aimed to solve this
           by providing long distance wireless charging through magnetic
           resonance technology. Although the project was cut short by the
           Covid-19 pandemic, we made significant progress in arranging the
           schematics, simulations, and developing drone attachment designs.
           My role in the project was to complete the coil simulation
           and optimization.

          <h4>Purpose:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Use a multiphysics simulation software (Comsol) to simulate
                magnetic resonance power transfer between a transmitter and
                receiver coil</li>
            <li>Optimize coil design for long distance  power transfer and use
                these optimized parameters to manufacture coil</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Challenges:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Learn a new software and debug simulation and provide results
                within deadlines</li>
            <li>Create a simulation that would provide accurate results, but
                use assumptions that were valid</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Process:</h4>
