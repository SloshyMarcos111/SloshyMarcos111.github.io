        <h1>SolidWorks Modeling and Rendering</h1>
        <h4>Overview:</h4>
        <p>Being well versed in CAD software and rendering is important to me as
           I pursue a career in robotics and design. This is why I have earned
           my CSWA certification and continue to practice CAD modelling and
           rendering with interesting objects.
          </p>
          <h4>Purpose:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>To practice learned skills and learn new skills through modeling
                complex objects</li>
            <li>To learn more about how to create a good render</li>
            <li>Create a good representation of my CAD technique</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Challenges:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Learn a new software and debug simulation and provide results
                within deadlines</li>
            <li>Create a simulation that would provide accurate results, but
                use assumptions that were valid</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Outcome:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Modeled a Pentel Graphgear 2000 pencil in Solidworks by creating
                each individual part and mating them together to exercise good
                assembly practices</li>
            <li>Learned about SolidWorks surface modeling and applied it to
                create a sci-fi helmet similar to the design language used in
                one of my favorite video games</li>
            <li>Researched PhotoView 360 and used it to create a render with
                adjusted lighting and material assignments</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Skills Learned:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Extrusion and surface modeling of complex geometry</li>
            <li>Working with assemblies</li>
            <li>Assigning materials, lights, and effects to create a finished
                rendered piece fit for presentation.</li>
          </ul>
